# 🌟 Welcome to Nacto Care! 🌟
Nacto Care is on a mission to address the critical shortage of nurses in India while revolutionizing the delivery of healthcare services. Our focus is on empowering nurses and enhancing healthcare accessibility to make a meaningful impact in the world's largest democracy.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
India faces a significant shortage of nurses, with only 2.06 nurses per 1,000 people, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2023. This shortage, largely due to migration stemming from lack of opportunities, puts a strain on the healthcare system and limits access to essential medical services, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly.

## 💡 Our Solution
Nacto Care aims to provide better opportunities and support for Indian nurses, enabling them to thrive in their profession. Our approach includes:

 ### 🩺 Empowering Nurses
Work Opportunities: Offering a variety of nursing positions with competitive benefits.
Training Programs: Providing continuous education and skill development.
